### Abstract
Spatial reasoning is an important component of human intelligence. We can imagine the shapes of 3D objects and reason about their spatial relations by merely looking at their three-view line drawings in 2D, with different levels of competence. Can deep networks be trained to perform spatial reasoning tasks? How can we measure their "spatial intelligence"? To answer these questions, we present the SPARE3D dataset. Based on cognitive science and psychometrics, SPARE3D contains three types of 2D-3D reasoning tasks on view consistency, camera pose, and shape generation, with increasing difficulty. We then design a method to automatically generate a large number of challenging questions with ground truth answers for each task. They are used to provide supervision for training our baseline models using state-of-the-art architectures like ResNet. Our experiments show that although convolutional networks have achieved superhuman performance in many visual learning tasks, their spatial reasoning performance in SPARE3D is almost equal to random guesses. We hope SPARE3D can stimulate new problem formulations and network designs for spatial reasoning to empower intelligent robots to operate effectively in the 3D world via 2D sensors.

### Dataset
You can download the dataset via [our google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mi2KZyKAlUOGYRQTDz3E5nhiXY5GhUB2?usp=sharing). This google drive folder contains three zip files: 
1. Task_data.zip is for training baseline;
2. CSG_model_step.zip contains 11149 CSG models;
3. Total_view_data contains view drawings of all ABC and CSG models from 11 pose we define in the paper.

Please feel free to report bugs or other problems to [the authors](https://ai4ce.github.io).


## Requirements
You can find all baseline models in the [Code](https://github.com/ai4ce/spare3d/Code) folder. All the baseline models are written for Python 3.7.4 and Pytorch 1.3.0 with CUDA enabled GPU. And the data generation code in [Data_generate_script](https://github.com/ai4ce/spare3d/Data_generate_script) folder. The dependencies Python packages: [Bagnet](https://github.com/wielandbrendel/bag-of-local-features-models), [Pythonocc](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core), [cairosvg](https://cairosvg.org/documentation/) and [cv2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/). 

## Data generation
You could directly download the dataset we generate for each task through [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mi2KZyKAlUOGYRQTDz3E5nhiXY5GhUB2?usp=sharing). You can also generate more data by using the code we provide in [Data_generate_script](https://github.com/ai4ce/spare3d/Data_generate_script). Commands to create the data:
```bash
python P2I.py -pathread "a floder consists of Step files" -pathwrite "a output folder"
python Three2I.py -pathread "a floder consists of Step files" -pathwrite "a output folder"
python I2P.py -pathread "a floder consists of Step files" -pathwrite "a output folder"
```
These commands will generate data in SVG format. We also provide a simple script to convert SVG to PNG format if you need (Notice: This code will delete the svg files after converting. If you need original SVG files, please make a copy before you use this script).  
```bash
python svg2png.py -f "a folder of SVG files" 
```
## Train
You can simple train our baseline models as following commands: 
```bash
python I2P.py --Training_dataroot "path to training dataset" --Validating_dataroot "path to validating dataset" --outf "folder to output log"
```
You can use similar command to train all other baseline models listed in [Code](https://github.com/ai4ce/spare3d/Code) folder.
